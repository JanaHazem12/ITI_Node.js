        <h3 style="text-align: center;">The universe stretches endlessly above us, a masterpiece painted in stars. Each light holds the mystery of distant worlds waiting to be discovered. In the silence of space, the cosmos whispers stories of time, creation, and wonder. Every star is a reminder of how vast and limitless existence can be. Galaxies swirl in perfect harmony, each movement a reflection of the universeâ€™s delicate balance. Planets orbit in silent grace, carrying secrets of life yet to be uncovered. Nebulas bloom like cosmic flowers, their colors telling tales of birth and destruction. Black holes, dark and mysterious, guard the edges of understanding. Amidst the infinite expanse, Earth is but a tiny speck, yet filled with life and curiosity. In every glance at the night sky, we are reminded of how much more there is to learnâ€”and how beautiful the unknown can be.ðŸŒŒâœ¨</h3>
